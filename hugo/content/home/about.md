# Hello!

I am a Software Engineer in Moscow, Russia. I have recently attained my Master in Information Technology at Skoltech and TPU, and also studied at MIT as a special student.

In my free time, I like surfing, hiking and traveling. I've worked and studied in USA, and visited Kyrgyzstan, Hong Kong, Ireland, Germany, France, Finland, Belarus, Mexico, Georgia and Turkey.
